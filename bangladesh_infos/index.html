        Measuring <br>Children’s Work<br> in South Asia
    </h1>
   <p class="container">
    <strong>Over 6.3 million children in Bangladesh are in employment, many in agriculture and paid work.</strong> Overall, 17.5 per cent of Bangladeshi children 
    between 7-17 years of age are in employment. Bangladesh has the highest employment ratio for 7-14 year old and 15-17 year old children of any 
    South Asian nation reporting comparable data. Among 7-17 year old children who work and don’t attend school, 42.4 per cent are in paid 
    positions while 30.1 per cent are unpaid family workers. Agriculture is the largest employer of Bangladeshi children who work and don’t 
    go to school, with 41.3 per cent of those children aged 7-17 working in agriculture, 21.7 per cent in services and 19.1 per cent in 
    manufacturing.<br><br> <strong> A little over three-quarters of Bangladeshi children between 7-17 years of age attend school.</strong> The school attendance rate 
    is 85.1 per cent for 7-14 year olds, dropping by more than half to 41.9 per cent for children in the 15-17 year old age group. Bangladesh 
    has the lowest school attendance rate among 15-17 year olds of any nation in South Asia.<br><br> <strong>Over 4.1 million Bangladeshi children between 7-17 
    years of age are neither working nor in school.</strong> The inactivity rate for all 7-17 year old children is 11.3 per cent, the highest of any 
    country in South Asia with comparable data. There is a large gender divide in inactivity, with girls representing 63.2 per cent of 
    Bangladesh’s inactive 7-17 year old children. <br><br>
